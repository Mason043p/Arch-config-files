Be sure to change the xrandr configuration in my configuration file! As well as the bar output to correspond with your monitors.
If you wish to use the i3 status I have on the top right of my screen, you will need to install my i3status.conf file. 
If you wish not to use the i3 status, remove "status_command i3status" from the first bar I reference in the i3 configuration file.
