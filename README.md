I reference 2 bars in my i3 configuration file, one for my primary monitor (with i3status), and one for my secondary montior (without i3status)
  be sure to change the xrandr configuration in my  i3 configuration file. As well as the bar output to correspond with your monitors,
if you wish to use the i3 status I have on the top right of my screen, you will need to install my i3status.conf file. 
If you wish not to use the i3 status, remove "status_command i3status", and you can remove the second bar in the i3 configuration file. If your using 2 monitors it will automatically display 2 bars on both, I just made the 2 bars in the configuration so I could have i3status on one.
